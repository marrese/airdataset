App Description

This simple application browses through real pollution data taken by ArpaPuglia.
The dataset contains the the first semester of 2014 pollutants as resulted from 10 stations in Taranto province.
The App purpose is to facilitate users in exploring the dataset and operate some first and simple visual correlation 
on pollution trend and causes.
A generalized plot is created as soon as the user put the query by mean of widgets. Starting from the overall picture 
the user may focalize on a particular time period or monitoring station. 
Aside of a scatterplot the graphic also draws a smooth line and interval around the observed data.
The user can visualize and compare data for each of the following pollutant:
- **PM10** and **PM2.5** - particulate matter
- **CO** - carbonic anidride
- **SO2** - sulfur dioxide
- **O3** - ozone
- **C6H6** - Benzene
- **H2S** - hydrogen sulfide
- **iqa** - general quality index (calculated on previous values)
- by setting time period, color, station, an in-depth
   exploration  is quite easy to perform.</small>
